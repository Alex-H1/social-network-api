# Social-network-api

## Description 
This is my Social Network api. This applicatation utilizes mongodb as a no sql mongoose, express and moment.js. This is an api that you can share and react to friends thoughts.

## Installation 
This application was not provided any code, so first I started with the models and made a Reaction field for the Thought model. Next I made the controllers along with the server.js and config.js to establish the relation ship between the server and the database. I then made the the routes that utilized the controllers.
